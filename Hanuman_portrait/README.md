# Hanuman Turtle Art — Orange Portrait Drawing 🖌️🐢
This project uses Python’s Turtle Graphics to create a detailed orange-colored portrait on a black background.

The artwork is drawn step-by-step using various turtle commands like circle(), fd(), and goto() to form curves, shapes, and details.

# Features
Uses Python Turtle for vector-style drawing.

Complex design with multiple shapes, curves, and fills.

Orange color theme (#FF8C00) with black background.

Multiple parts such as face, ears, neck, shoulders, and hair.

Custom detailing and filled shapes for realistic effects.

# Output Preview
When you run the code, you’ll see a vibrant orange portrait drawn from scratch by the turtle, stroke by stroke.

# Requirements
Python 3.x

Turtle graphics library (comes pre-installed with Python)

# Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/turtle-art.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:

cd turtle-art

3. Run the Python file:

python turtle_art.py

# How It Works
The turtle is moved to precise coordinates using goto().

Curves and arcs are created with circle() and angle adjustments.

Shapes are filled using begin_fill() and end_fill().

Layers of shapes form different elements of the portrait.
